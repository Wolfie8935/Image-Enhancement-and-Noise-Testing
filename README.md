## Inferences
- The model works preety good with low light images.
- We have used salt and peeper noise to train the model with a relistic low light image although it is not tested for other type of noises.
- The model is producing inappropriate results in case of enhancing a very bright section of an image. The reason might be due to presence of salt pepper noise and might produce better results in case of real-time low light image.
